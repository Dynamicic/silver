Overview
========

A Python SDK for interacting with a Silver server. For now this is the basic
setup. It will contain a client library for building tools around the Silver
service, as well as some basic commandline functionality for interacting with a
server.

The core of this client library is `PySwagger`_, which makes use of schemas
generated by `Django Rest Swagger`_.
