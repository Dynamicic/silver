========
Overview
========

A Python SDK for interacting with a Silver server. For now this is the basic
setup. It will contain a client library for building tools around the Silver
service, as well as some basic commandline functionality for interacting with a
server.

The core of this client library is `PySwagger`_, which makes use of schemas
generated by `Django Rest Swagger`_. 

.. _PySwagger: https://github.com/pyopenapi/pyswagger
.. _Django Rest Swagger:  https://django-rest-swagger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Installation
============

::

    pip install silversdk


Quickstart
==========

After installing the library, set up your environment: copy `dotenv-in`
to `.env` and configure your environment variables. These will be loaded
via dotenv.

To check that it's working, run the following and observe that API
endpoints display.

::

    silversdk --endpoints

If everything works you should be able to use the library. The main
point of entry to using the library is `silversdk.client.SilverClient`,
which handles authentication and provides access to a `bravado` client
instance via `SilverClient.client`.

`SilverClient` will also contain some helpful shortcuts for things
beyond the base `client` API.

Development
===========

To run the all tests run::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 90
    :stub-columns: 1

    - - Windows
      - ::

            set PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append
            tox

    - - Other
      - ::

            PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append tox
